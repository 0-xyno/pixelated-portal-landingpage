# Welcome to **0-xyn** - The Pixelated Portal of Programming Prowess!

## A Bit About 0-xyn
This is where the magic happens - or at least where I pretend it does. Here, you'll find my digital footprint, painted with the nostalgia of 8-bit Final Fantasy characters.

## How to Edit:
- **HTML:** Your canvas for content.
- **CSS:** The magic wand for styling.
- **JS:** For any interactive spells you wish to cast (currently none, but the future is unpredictable!).
